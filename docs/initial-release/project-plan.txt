CloudOps Cost & Reliability Guardrails
High-Level Project Plan (Authoritative)

============================================================

PRODUCT OVERVIEW

CloudOps Cost & Reliability Guardrails is a deployable AWS application that helps teams:

Detect unexpected AWS cost spikes

Monitor service reliability for a critical API

Generate actionable recommendations

Track alerts and resolutions over time

Operate with minimal setup in any AWS account

The application is designed as an installable AWS stack, not a custom consulting setup or manual dashboard.

GUIDING PRINCIPLES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

V1 ships — V2 and V3 are future updates only

Easy adoption — no manual AWS wiring after deploy

Stateful system — history, alerts, and actions are persisted

Production-style architecture — not a demo or toy project

CloudFormation-based install — scalable, repeatable, safe

Explainable design — every alert can be reasoned about

ADOPTION & USAGE MODEL

Deployment:

Users deploy via AWS SAM (CloudFormation)

Deployment creates all required infrastructure

Minimal parameters are required

After Deployment:

Stack outputs:

Application URL (CloudFront)

Login URL (Cognito Hosted UI)

User logs in with email/password

Ingestion jobs begin automatically

Data appears without additional configuration

No dashboards to configure
No scripts to run
No AWS expertise required beyond deployment

ARCHITECTURE (V1 – FIXED)

Frontend:

S3 static website

CloudFront distribution

HTML / CSS / JavaScript

Uses Cognito-issued JWT tokens

Authentication:

Amazon Cognito

Hosted UI

Email/password authentication

API Gateway authorizer

Backend API:

Amazon API Gateway

AWS Lambda (Python)

Stateless request handling

CRUD over alerts, recommendations, summaries

Data Store:

Amazon RDS PostgreSQL

Single instance (V1)

Relational schema for historical analysis

Background Jobs:

Amazon EventBridge schedules

Lambda jobs for:

Cost ingestion

Reliability metric ingestion

Anomaly detection

Infrastructure:

AWS SAM (template.yaml)

Single CloudFormation stack

IAM least-privilege roles

CI/CD-ready

DATA MODEL (V1 – FIXED)

Core Tables:

projects (single default project in V1)

daily_costs

reliability_metrics

alerts

recommendations

events (audit trail + future extensibility)

Status Models:

Alerts: open, acknowledged, resolved

Recommendations: open, in_progress, done, dismissed

All records are timestamped and immutable where appropriate.

FUNCTIONAL SCOPE (V1 – SHIPPED)

Cost Guardrails:

Daily AWS cost ingestion via Cost Explorer

30-day rolling window by service

Anomaly detection using fixed thresholds

Alert + recommendation generation

Reliability Guardrails:

CloudWatch metrics ingestion for one API Gateway

Metrics:

5XX errors

p95 latency

Rolling baseline anomaly detection

Alert + recommendation generation

Alerting & Recommendations:

Alerts generated automatically

Recommendations linked to alerts

User updates recommendation status

System tracks lifecycle and history

User Interface:

Summary dashboard

Cost trend view

Alerts list + detail

Recommendations list + status updates

Authentication & Access:

Cognito login

Authenticated API access

Single admin user to start

EXPLICIT OUT-OF-SCOPE (V1)

Multi-account support

Advanced ML forecasting

Full SLO / error-budget math

Slack or PagerDuty integrations

Policy-as-code enforcement

Kubernetes or containers

Real-time streaming pipelines

Complex RBAC

These are intentionally deferred.

SCALABILITY MODEL (V1)

Automatically Scales:

CloudFront (frontend)

API Gateway (API)

Lambda (compute)

EventBridge (jobs)

Primary Scaling Constraint:

PostgreSQL instance

Scales vertically

RDS Proxy / Aurora supported later

Architecture is designed to scale without rewrites.

DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY

Primary Installer:

AWS SAM CLI (sam deploy --guided)

Optional:

CloudFormation Launch Stack button

Required Parameters:

Admin email

AWS Region

Monitored API Gateway identifier

Optional demo mode flag

DEVELOPMENT PHASES (EXECUTION PLAN)

Phase 0 — Planning & Foundation:

Lock architecture and roadmap

Create repo structure

Create SAM scaffold

Define DB schema

Write README skeleton

Phase 1 — Frontend Shell:

Static UI deployed

Navigation and layout complete

Fake data wired in

Phase 2 — Backend API:

API Gateway + Lambdas live

Postgres connected

Real data endpoints

Phase 3 — Ingestion Jobs:

Cost Explorer ingestion

CloudWatch metric ingestion

Scheduled execution

Phase 4 — Guardrails Logic:

Anomaly detection rules

Alerts + recommendations

End-to-end flow complete

Phase 5 — Polish & Ship:

Error handling

Demo mode

Screenshots

README finalization

VERSIONING STRATEGY

V1 — Foundational Platform (SHIPPED):

All functionality described above

Production-ready

Minimal friction

V2 — Operational Maturity (Future):

Explainable anomalies

Tag coverage & allocation

Notifications

Audit UI

Job failure handling

V3 — Senior / Enterprise Signals (Future):

SLOs & error budgets

Cross-signal correlation

Unit cost metrics

Multi-project / multi-account

DEFINITION OF “DONE” (V1)

V1 is complete when:

App deploys via CloudFormation

Login works

Cost data ingests successfully

Reliability metrics ingest successfully

Alerts are generated

Recommendations are actionable

UI reflects real data

README explains architecture and decisions

OUTCOME

This project demonstrates:

AWS architecture competence

Distributed systems thinking

FinOps and SRE awareness

Product design discipline

Real-world deployability

This is not a demo.
This is not a toy.
This is a credible CloudOps application.
